        Uploading, downloading, deleting and listing Amazon S3 object using the AWS SDK for C++.
    :keywords:

An |S3| object represents a *file*, which is a collection of data. Every object must reside within a
:doc:`bucket <examples-s3-buckets>`.

.. include:: includes/examples-note.txt

.. _upload-object:

Upload an Object
================

Use the |s3client| object :functionname:`PutObject` function, supplying it with a bucket name, key
name, and file to upload. *The bucket must exist or an error will result*.

**Includes**

.. literalinclude:: example_code/s3/put_object.cpp
   :lines: 14-18

**Code**

.. literalinclude:: example_code/s3/put_object.cpp
   :lines: 45-70
   :dedent: 8

See the :sdk-examples-cpp:`complete example <s3/put_object.cpp>`.

.. _list-objects:

List Objects
============

To get a list of objects within a bucket, use the |s3client| object :functionname:`ListObjects`
function. Supply it with a :classname:`ListObjectsRequest` that you set with the name of a bucket
to list the contents of.

The :functionname:`ListObjects` function returns a :classname:`ListObjectsOutcome` object that you can
use to get a list of objects in the form of :classname:`Object` instances.

**Includes**

.. literalinclude:: example_code/s3/list_objects.cpp
   :lines: 14-17

**Code**

.. literalinclude:: example_code/s3/list_objects.cpp
   :lines: 39-61
   :dedent: 8

See the :sdk-examples-cpp:`complete example <s3/list_objects.cpp>`.


.. _download-object:

Download an Object
==================

Use the |s3client| object :functionname:`GetObject` function, passing it a
:classname:`GetObjectRequest` that you set with the name of a bucket and the object key to download.
:functionname:`GetObject` returns a :classname:`GetObjectOutcome` object that you can use to
access
the S3 object's data.

The following example downloads an object from |S3| and saves its contents to a file (using the same
name as the object's key).

**Includes**

.. literalinclude:: example_code/s3/get_object.cpp
   :lines: 14-17

**Code**

.. literalinclude:: example_code/s3/get_object.cpp
   :lines: 42-61
   :dedent: 8

See the :sdk-examples-cpp:`complete example <s3/get_object.cpp>`.


.. _delete-object:

Delete an Object
================

Use the |s3client| object's :functionname:`DeleteObject` function, passing it a
:classname:`DeleteObjectRequest` that you set with the name of a bucket and object to download.
*The specified bucket and object key must exist or an error will result*.

**Includes**

.. literalinclude:: example_code/s3/delete_object.cpp
